## Installation

```bash
sudo apt install vim
```

## Setup

* Copy `.vimrc` to `~/`

## Plugins
This vim setup relies on [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin handling. If you want to use the `.vimrc` you should either install Vundle first or get rid of all the plugins declared in the `.vimrc`. 

If you decide to go with Vundle you need to install all plugins once. Simply start vim and run `:PluginInstall` to install all declared plugins.
